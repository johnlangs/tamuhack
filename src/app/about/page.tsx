      <p className="py-6 mb-5 text-xl pr-60 pb-40"> The internet has an extensive distribution of personally identifiable information 
                including birthdays, peronal interests, family, connections, professional roles, and much more across multiple platforms 
                and regions you might not know exist. These vulnerable information provides a ground for threats to fertilize, orchestrating
                various ways to attack and impersonate individuals without their knowledge. In response to this challenge, we created this 
                website to serve the purpose of developing an innovative tool that can help educate and provide preventative resources for you. 
                This website provides resources to proactively detect potential phishing attempts and open-source intelligence 
                impersonations. We hope to bring awareness and security in the face of evolving online threats.
