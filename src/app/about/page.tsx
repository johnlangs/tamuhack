                birthdays, interests, family, connections, and professional roles, across multiple social media platforms 
                and the internet. This information has provided a ground for threat actors to fertilize and orchestrate
                various ways to attack and impersonate individuals without their knowledge. In response to this challenge, this 
                website is created to serve the purpose of developing an innovative application, methodology, or tool. 
                The primary objective is to proactively detect potential phishing attempts and guide users to explore 
                their options for open-source intelligence that could be employed for impersonation purposes.
                This website aims to boost user awareness and security in the face of evolving online threats.
